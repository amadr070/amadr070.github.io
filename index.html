        <div class="subheading mb-5">Media and Cultural StudiesðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Alessa Janay Madrigal and I am 18 years old. Currently I am a first year student at UCR. I am currently majoring in Media and Cultural Studies. My dream and plan is to become a sports journalist and one day work for a major sports news station. I love sports, especially football and baseball, I have some knowledge about basketball that and my skills in writing is what has led me to want to become a sports journalist. I was born in Banning, CA and went to Beaumont High School. I graduated with a 4.0 GPA, I took multiple AP and college courses while in high school. I passed three of the tests in my AP classes that put me ahead in my studies in college. In high school I was a part of 3 clubs MEChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan), Dual Language Immersion Club and Associate Student Body. I am of hispanic heritage, both of my parents are Mexican immigrants and I have a close ties with my heritage. I have travelled to Mexico among to other countries including Canada, Guatemala and Brazil.<br><br>

        I have many skills, to start off I am bilingual in Spanish and English, I speak both languages fluently. During high school I took AP Spanish Language and AP Spanish Literature, I passed both of the tests which helped me earn a seal of biliteracy from Riverside County and the state of California. Another skill I have is my cleanliness, I do have OCD but it is at a good level, where it helps me to keep things around my environment organized and have things as accessible as possible. Writing is one of my other proficient skills, I have come a long way and with the help of my teachers. I have found that writing is something that I enjoy doing, especially when the topic is something that I have a lot of interest in and I am able to artistically write about something that I enjoy and have fun with it.<br><br>

        I as a person show a lot of dedication to my work and try my best to get things done quickly while doing a good job.  I have had problems with my social skills but it is something that I have improved and I am able to have good conversations and give speeches. For the most part I am quiet, I was a shy kid growing up and I don't like to bring a lot of attention to myself. I have a lot of patience, I know that things can take a long time and I have been in those situations, even though there are times where I end up running out of patience but it is only in extreme cases and I usually try to come up with a solution. That also another thing about me when I have a problem, I do stress out about it but something that I automatically do is I immediately try to come up with a solution.
